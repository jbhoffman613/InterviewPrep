# InterviewPrep
Here is a collection of various coding challenge problems that I have completed. This repo stands not only as an example of the prep work I have done, but I also hope to have it be a repository of solutions and coding challenge for NU CCIS majors applyng for co-op in the future. 

If you look in the Java directory, you will find a directory with both examples of Java coding challenges but also tests accompanying that act as verification for the work I have done. 

In the future, I hope to add more directories with examples of coding challenges in them.
